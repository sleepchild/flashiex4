torch app for the moto x4 [needs root]

## you can:
- turn on/off individual leds (3)
- adjust brightness
- quicksetting toggle


### about moto x4 leds
- the x4 has 3 main leds. 
yellow and white on the back (dual tone). and white on the front.
- it also has a 4rth very tiny notification led in between the front led and speaker. (still working on it)

- add a proper check for root
- add a no root implementation
- and a layout for noroot mode
